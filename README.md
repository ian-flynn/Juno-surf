## Contribute

This is an Open Source app, so I would love to hear any and all suggestions. I will of course consider and welcome all pull requests that contribute to the goal.

Some of my planned features include:

- Testing Suite
- Backend setup with Node/Express
- OAuth
- MongoDB for user data
  -- Store closest buoy to user, so the app displays more relevant data.
- And more...
